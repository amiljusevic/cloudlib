Middleware for in application use
=================================

Ever wish you didn't have to develop some general purpose libraries and or
middleware which you simply tote around between applications making simple
tweaks when appropriate or blindly copying and pasting as needed? If so,
then this is a library you can sink your code into.


Why
---

I built this because I use the same code over and over again and I'm tired of
copying the same bits between projects. So now, if I have something that's
general purpose enough I'm going to put it in library which I'll use throughout
my applications as I develop them.
